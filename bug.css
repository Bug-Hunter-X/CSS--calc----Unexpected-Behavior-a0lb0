The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a nested element might not work as expected if the parent element's width isn't precisely defined.  Another issue is that `calc()` won't work with certain CSS properties, for example, setting the width and height in percentages at the same time and expecting it to work.
